JUST DO THIS:

sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev
sudo apt-get install zlibc zlib1g zlib1g-dev

Dependencies :
--------------
You should have the following libraries installed to use steghide.

* libmhash
  A library that provides various hash algorithms and cryptographic key
  generation algorithms. Steghide needs this library to convert a passphrase
  into a form that can be used as input for cryptographic and steganographic
  algorithms.
  Available at: http://mhash.sourceforge.net/
  Debian (Ubuntu): sudo apt-get install libmhash-dev

* libmcrypt  
  A library that provides a lot of symmetric encryption algorithms. If you
  compile steghide without libmcrypt you will not be able to use steghide to
  encrypt data before embedding nor to extract encrypted data (even if you know
  the correct passphrase).
  Available at: http://mcrypt.sourceforge.net/
  Debian (Ubuntu): sudo apt-get install libmcrypt-dev

* libjpeg
  A library implementing jpeg image compression. Without this library you will
  not be able to embed data in jpeg files nor to extract data from jpeg files.
  Available at: http://www.ijg.org/
  Debian (Ubuntu): sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev

* zlib
  A lossless data compression library. If you compile steghide without having
  this library installed you will not be able to use steghide to compress data
  before embedding nor to extract compressed data from a stego-file.
  Available at: http://www.gzip.org/zlib/
  Debian (Ubuntu): sudo apt-get install zlibc zlib1g zlib1g-dev

Libmhash is absolutely required to compile steghide. While you can compile it
without the other libraries they are highly recommended as major functionality
will not be available without them.
